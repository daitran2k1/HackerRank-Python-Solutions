## Installation

Some problems need `numpy` package installed. I also use pre-commit to format my codes, you can check it at `.pre-commit-config.yaml`.

To install all required packages, run:

```bash
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

To install pre-commit for automatic code formatting, run once:

```bash
pre-commit install
```
